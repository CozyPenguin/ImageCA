# ImageCA

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/CozyPenguin/ImageCA.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/CozyPenguin/ImageCA)

## Introduction

Work in progress software for analyzing image databases and processing colors. It was originally developed for a contribution to the German project Lab2Venture (<http://www.lab2venture.de/>).

## Installation

Currently there are no prebuilt binaries. If you want to build the project from source, there's a guide for it in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Features

**These are currently not existent and describe the project when it's finished!**

ImageCA provides a way to analyse one or several images. It is capable of extracting a colour from one or several points in the image. These colours can be processed separately or be combined into a single colour, e.g. to get the average colour of a probe.
